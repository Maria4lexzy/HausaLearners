I want you to analyze my entire project and produce a fully structured technical overview of how the app currently works.

Please examine all project files and generate a documentation output with the following sections:

1. High-level overview

What the app does

Architecture summary (client, server, shared, DB)

Tech stack (frameworks, libraries, tools)

2. Project structure explanation

For each top-level directory (client, server, rest-express, db, shared, migrations, dist, etc.) explain:

What this folder contains

What part of the app it belongs to

Why it exists

How the parts communicate

3. Backend analysis

Framework used (Express? Hono? Custom?)

How routes/controllers are structured

Middlewares

Auth logic

Where DB connections occur

How validation works

Any known potential issues

Please also include:

A list of all API endpoints and what they do

The flow of a typical request from client → server → DB → client

4. Database system (drizzle + postgres)

Extract and list all schema definitions

Explain all tables, columns, types, and relationships

Summaries of enums, relations, foreign keys

Show how migrations are organized

Show how drizzle.config.ts is set up

Show how DB is initialized on server startup

5. Frontend analysis (client folder)

Framework (likely Vite + React + TypeScript)

UI structure (pages, components, hooks, styles)

Where global state is stored

How API calls are made

Build and dev commands (vite)

6. Shared folder analysis

List all TypeScript types/interfaces

Describe what is shared between frontend + backend

Note anything that can be improved

7. Deployment guide (generate a full guide)

Based on the project content, produce deployment steps for:

✔ Local development (Node + Postgres)
✔ Using Docker
✔ Production deployment options:

Render

Railway

Docker compose

DigitalOcean Apps

Fly.io

Include:

Build steps

Environment variables

Database migrations

Start commands

Port configs

8. Maintenance checklist

Generate a list of things to maintain over time:

Updating dependencies

Running DB migrations

Keeping env values correct

Checking logs & errors

Testing endpoints

Performance checks

Backup strategy for PostgreSQL

9. Suggestions for improvement

Give me a prioritized list of improvements for:

Backend code quality

Frontend UX

Database design

Project structure

Scalability

Error handling

Security

10. BONUS: Add “Boot.dev style UI enhancements”

Based on the client code, suggest improvements to turn the UI into a “gamified learning experience” like Boot.dev:

Add XP, streaks, quests, progress bar

Level and chapter system

Reward animations

Dashboard redesign

Challenge/quest system structure

Best place in the code to add these features
