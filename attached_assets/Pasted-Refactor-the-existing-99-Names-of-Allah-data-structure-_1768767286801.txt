Refactor the existing 99 Names of Allah data structure and content with a focus on religious accuracy, learning effectiveness, and long-term maintainability.

Goals

Preserve simplicity (static app, no backend)

Avoid unauthenticated claims or guaranteed outcomes

Improve clarity for non-Arabic speakers

Prepare the data for quizzes, filtering, and daily learning

1️⃣ Update the TypeScript Interface

Replace the current interface:

interface Name {
  number: number;
  arabic: string;
  transliteration: string;
  meaning: string;
  benefit: string;
}


With:

interface AsmaName {
  id: number;
  arabic: string;
  transliteration: string;
  meaning: string;
  reflection: string;
  duaUsage?: string;
  tags?: string[];
}

2️⃣ Content Guidelines (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do NOT include:

Specific numeric repetitions (e.g. “recite 100 times”)

Guaranteed worldly outcomes (wealth, pregnancy, protection, etc.)

Instructions involving rituals or conditions

DO include:

Short, neutral reflections based on widely accepted Islamic understanding

General ways the Name is used in dua (without promises)

Simple, clear language suitable for beginners

Example transformation:

❌ Before:

benefit: "Repeating 41 times after prayer brings wealth"


✅ After:

reflection: "This Name reminds us that all provision comes from Allah alone.",
duaUsage: "Often used when asking Allah for sustenance and ease."

3️⃣ Tags for Learning & Quizzes

Add 2–4 simple tags per Name, such as:

"forgiveness"

"mercy"

"patience"

"guidance"

"strength"

"anxiety"

Tags should be meaningful and useful for:

Scenario-based quizzes

Filtering (“Names for comfort”)

Daily Name recommendations

4️⃣ Meaning & Naming Consistency

Ensure all 99 Names are included exactly once

Handle repeated meanings carefully (e.g. similar Names should have nuanced meanings)

Avoid duplicated Arabic names

Keep transliteration consistent (e.g. Al-, Ar-, As-)

5️⃣ Output Requirements

Provide the fully updated namesData array

Use clean, readable formatting

Keep everything compatible with a static React + TypeScript app

Do not add external dependencies

Tone & Intent

This is a faith-based educational app.
The content must be:

Respectful

Non-dogmatic

Free of speculative or weak claims

Focused on reflection, understanding, and personal growth
